            </ul>
            <p>
              We began in the year 2021, and during that time, the Coronavirus was prevalent. Due to the virus, we had online classes, and we thoroughly enjoyed them. Initially, I didn't know anyone, but through the online classes, we started to get to know each other. We created an online group, on Facebook perhaps, and that's where we all connected. Gradually, the unfamiliar faces became familiar.
  
              After some time, we became so well-connected that we felt the need to meet in person, even amidst the pandemic. One day, we all decided that we should gather, chat, and have a great time, either at our institute or some other place. We discussed and set a date to meet at our favorite campus. On that day, everyone met face-to-face for the first time, and our journey began.
  
              Everyone was elated. We recognized each other's familiar faces, explored a new college, and made new friends. The day was filled with excitement, and since then, our batchmates have become such great classmates that the institute's staff often hears us express our desire to stay at the institute for the rest of our lives.

            <h3>Farewell day of Muhammad Ashraful Alam Muaaz sir.</h3>
            <p>
              Our college journey began around 2020-2021. However, due to the significant impact of the coronavirus, we had to commence our college life online.
  
              Our initial online class was led by Mr. Ashraful Alam Muaaz. Despite the online format, he ensured that we didn't feel disconnected from the learning experience. He even employed engaging teaching methods.
  
              As the impact of the coronavirus started to diminish, we gradually returned to physical college. Mr. Ashraful Alam Muaaz continued to be a friend and guide to all of us. He consistently motivated us and provided valuable advice on how to excel in our studies and other endeavors.
  
              The day eventually arrived when we had to bid farewell to him. It felt like losing a comforting presence, leaving us with a profound sense of loss.
  
              We hope that wherever he is, he reindexs in good health and enjoys a beautiful life.

            <h3>Farewell day of Md Golam Sarower Sir</h3>
            <ul>
  
            </ul>
            <ul>
  
            </ul>
            <p>
              In our computer department, the number of teachers is low. Everyone loves our teachers, and among them, one of our favorites is Sir Sarwar. We've had him since the 4th semester. His teaching is excellent, and he has never been indifferent to us. Our batch loved him just as much as he liked us.
  
              We enjoyed his classes a lot. The way our batch was his favorite, he was our favorite teacher too. We had a great time in his classes.
  
              One remarkable thing about Sir Sarwar is that he always amazed all of us. If we ever made a mistake or did something unfair, he would patiently explain it to us and would not hold it against us. The most significant thing we gained from him is his immense patience. He is a person who never gets angry with us.
  
              Due to personal problems, he had to leave the college. We all felt sad about it. We pray for him to be well wherever he is, and we hope he reindexs happy.

            <p>We, the 3rd batch of Idris Ali in the year 2021, entered the first field on December 16th with the same enthusiasm and determination as our seniors. Our dear Anis Sir led the cheers and the display team.
  
              During the preparation period, we had a lot of fun, just like the first time when we received awards. We were so happy, and when others saw our joy, they were also excited. With that, our institute excelled in both Kuchkawaz and Display, taking the first position. Then, on December 16th, 2022, in Kuchkawaz, we secured the third position, and in Display, we continued our winning streak, achieving first place once again.
  
              All of this success is the result of our hard work and dedication to preserving historical and cultural traditions. These days will reindex memorable to us.
  
              In the same year, on March 26th, on Independence Day, our display team once again clinched the first position in Kuchkawaz, just like a five-time champion. Our institute continues to indextain this legacy, and we hope to keep this tradition alive.</p>

              Amidst a drizzling rain, a rowboat rocked gently on the tranquil river, carrying many college friends on an impromptu adventure. Sarah, Alex, and Lisa had reunited after years apart and decided to embark on this spontaneous journey. They pushed their boat into the water, the raindrops creating rhythmic patterns on the surface.
  
              Laughter and memories filled the air as they rowed further into the misty river, raindrops dancing on their heads. Their clothes became drenched, but they didn't mind, for the rain added a touch of magic to the day. The river wound its way through lush landscapes, past quaint cottages, and beneath arched stone bridges.
  
              The rain intensified into a downpour, but they rowed on, feeling like children at play. After the storm, a magnificent rainbow graced the sky, a symbol of the beauty found in unexpected moments.
  
              Returning to shore, the setting sun cast a warm glow on their unforgettable day, sealing the bonds of friendship renewed under the rain.

            </ul>
            <p>In a bustling college town, four diverse souls found themselves sharing more than just a classroom. Studying different majors, they stumbled into each other's lives during a campus charity event. Quickly, they discovered a shared passion for music, and soon, jamming sessions became a weekly tradition.
  
              Their friendship deepened as they explored their town's hidden gems – from late-night diners to secret art exhibitions. They laughed through finals and celebrated successes together.
  
              When graduation loomed, they realized their lives were about to diverge. Pursuing careers in law, writing, science, and travel photography, they bid an emotional farewell. Despite the physical distance, they kept their bond unbreakable through postcards and video calls, celebrating life's milestones together. No matter where life took them, the harmony of their friendship played on, a reminder that even separate melodies can create a beautiful symphony of friendship.</p>
